# Predicting-Depression

The project being worked on aims to develop a machine learning model that will 
predict whether people are depressed by examining their data. As a result of the 
researches, it has been observed that many factors are effective on depression. There 
are some scales developed for diagnosis. These scales contain too many items and 
questions. The correct interpretation and evaluation of this content is a long and 
tiring process.

With the machine learning model to be developed, necessary evaluations will be 
made on the available data. As a result of these evaluations, the ratio of the effect of 
the answers to the questions asked on the result will be determined and the most 
accurate estimates will be made easier and faster. In addition, it is aimed to 
determine the evaluation criteria that do not affect the results and to shorten the 
evaluation processes of the patients.

The development process of the model started with a detailed investigation of the 
subject. In order to get to know the data set, information about the data to be 
processed was collected. Pre-processes to be made were determined by interpreting 
in more detail with visualizations. Preprocessing steps were carried out and the data 
set was made ready for machine learning algorithms. Machine learning algorithms to 
be used for the data set will be determined as a result of literature review and 
necessary research.
